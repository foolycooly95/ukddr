**RULES**

- Don't be an asshole.
- Be socially aware.
- Don't discriminate.
- No sharing links to arcade data.
- No NSFW content or discussion, this is a server for anyone old enough to use Discord.

**Other things of note**
- Arcade data scores are allowed, please specify if they're on pad or keyboard though.
- Invites are enabled. However, known bad eggs in the community will be banned without hesitation by me or other moderators.
- This is a DDR space, of course you're free to talk about whatever but please do not derail discussions to make it about SMX/PIU/ITG.
